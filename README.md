# 🎓 Hybrid RAG Academy Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI assistant for **Kalashala Beauty & Makeup Academy** that answers academy-related queries using a local Large Language Model (LLM), Hybrid Search, and Cross-Encoder Reranking.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hybrid RAG Academy Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot that provides accurate and context-aware answers about courses, fees, trainers, admissions, certifications, and other academy-related information.

Instead of relying solely on an LLM, the assistant retrieves relevant information from a structured knowledge base using **Hybrid Retrieval (FAISS + BM25)** and improves relevance using **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking** before generating a response with **Ollama (Llama 3)**.
